Merry christmas everybody! Ho ho ho!
Yeah sorry I was planning on releasing this yesterday (christmas)
but I was facing a slight issue. And because of that you have to install
EchOS differently now. I just find out all my previous releases of EchOS
don't work and for that I am so sorry! I never checked the releases out
until now. But now it should work because in order to run EchOS you have
to build the source code yourself which as long as you have Cosmos installed
it should be simple to run. If you need help to run EchOS I have a new
Documentation that should help with that. Check out the install section
of this readme. But yeah! Ten new features it made EchOS look different.
But yeah I hope you enjoy this new update! And have a merry christmas 
to you all!
