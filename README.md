Message of the day: (11/25/2022)
[
  Hello everyone! EchOS is now licensed under the GNU public license v2. Meaning users can now look at the source code and redistrubute it.
  The software is also free (as it always has.) Development so far is going okay. I have a confident feeling we may be able to release this earlier
  but I'm not getting my hopes to high. EchOS once again thank you to all the developers that have helped me with this project. (There are only 2 devs me and richard)
  if you want to constribute please please feel free to do so! Code suggestions really improve not just the code but with bugs and the operating system itself.
  anyways you guys all have a good day!

Sadly It is unable to boot on real hardware and will need vmware or a virtual machine for this to work.

The best way to install EchOS would be a virtual machine anyway since their is not a resson to install it on real hardware.
