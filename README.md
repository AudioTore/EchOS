About

EtchOS Is an Dos operating System written in C# With the help of Cosmos!

How to install:

Sadly It is unable to boot on real hardware and will need vmware or a virtual machine for this to work.

The best way to install EchOS would be a virtual machine anyway since their is not a resson to install it on real hardware.

  Hello everyone! The update is right at the next corner. I just wanna say Thank you @Richard5656 for helping and contributing to EchOS.
  Right now I am planning to make EchOS a big dos operating system. Originally I was gonna put a gui but I did notice that most dos operating systems can't do much
  other than open programs using a good old fashion floppy disk or something like that. I want this dos operating system to be packed with stuff. I want a Dos           operating system that has a lot of features that other Dos operating systems dont So I made EchOS to fix that problem.
  EchOS was made as a hobby project but also to take a whole new spin on Dos operating systems. I am working on EchOS and I'm planning on adding features and bug fixes   to make EchOS better each time. :)
