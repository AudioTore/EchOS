VERSION

EchOS 1.3


About

EtchOS Is an Dos operating System written in C# With the help of Cosmos!

How to install:

Sadly It is unable to boot on real hardware and will need vmware or a virtual machine for this to work.

The best way to install EchOS would be a virtual machine anyway since their is not a resson to install it on real hardware.

[
  Morning! EchOS 1.3 is finally now out. This OS really is coming together its starting to do most
  things a regular OS can do. It can calculate numbers it has a partially working file system.
  Oh and it can write and read text on files :) I recommend you go check out the new update.
  It's been difficult developing all these new features recently but it was worth it for the new update.
  Anyways cya!
