Message of the day: (12/12/2022)
[
  Hey everyone! I have some bad news :( EchOS is going to have to be delayed. The good news is the scratch version
  of EchOS should fix most of Cosmos issues. We had problems with the "Waiting for debugging connection" when down-
  loading the iso and loading it up in a vm. It seems like Cosmos either way just wasn't truthworthy for reliable 
  Downloads. This new EchOS version should fix that problem up. And hopefully with a little bit of C and assembly
  we can get this thing running on almost any hardware. At least on any virtual machine platform.. Anyways thats
  all I wanted to tell you! carry on with your day.

About

EtchOS Is an Dos operating System written in C# With the help of Cosmos!

How to install:

Sadly It is unable to boot on real hardware and will need vmware or a virtual machine for this to work.

The best way to install EchOS would be a virtual machine anyway since their is not a resson to install it on real hardware.
