- Message of the day: (1/1/2023)

Wait what? I thought it was 2022.. Happy new year!
New year new me they say! But this time its going to be new year new OS!
I'm going to continue the scratch project. EchOS will be migrating from cosmos
and into its own OS finally for the first time! I will not be sure on how long
this is gonna take but I will do everything I can to make sure it gets finished
as fast as I can :) Wow I still can't believe 2023 is here. I heard fireworks
all day. Well this year is better than last year. 2022 was pretty crazy but lets
make 2023 a great year for EchOS! Cya :)
