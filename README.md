 Hey guy! (Only some of you can get the reference..) I been doing good. Once again the new update is almost on its way.
 First I just wanna say I have updated the FaQ!! With new random questions! So yea go check it out.
 Also EchOS is almost here I promise! However once I post the new update it sadly may be a bit of a downgrade compare to
 the last update. Thats because that is going to be a kind of test build. EchOS 1.4 may have less features. This is because
 sense we are working from scratch I will be have to do EVERYTHING myself. Including make my OWN file system that isn't cosmos.
 However most of the commands should be there! Have a nice day!

How to install:

Sadly It is unable to boot on real hardware and will need vmware or a virtual machine for this to work.

The best way to install EchOS would be a virtual machine anyway since their is not a resson to install it on real hardware.
