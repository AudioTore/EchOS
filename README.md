Hey guy! So im back from my break and I been working on EchOS recently.
The new 1.6 update just came out! and as you can see if you download it
there are huge changes to everything! So the way EchOS is gonna work is 
now a lot different. We have moved from Cosmos and onto a more
stable and reliable alternative. All the source code has been
shifted to Java and theirs a resson for that. First of EchOS
is now cross platforum? What does that mean? That means you can
either run EchOS on top of your hostOS by running a file or 
downloading the bootable file that also comes with the release
and boot it in a virtual machine. EchOS now supports almost ALL
hardware including support for (but not limited to) virtualbox,
qemu, vmware, and even bare metal! How is it possible that EchOS
can run on top of java? Well by using a base OS (Debian) it auto-
matically starts up the Java virtual machine (JVM) then starts
up EchOS. As simple as that! Because this is a much more stable
option compared to cosmos you can expect better support and
better features to come out. I hope you guys enjoy this release :)
