About

EtchOS Is an Dos operating System written in C# With the help of Cosmos!

How to install:

Sadly It is unable to boot on real hardware and will need vmware or a virtual machine for this to work.

The best way to install EchOS would be a virtual machine anyway since their is not a resson to install it on real hardware.
