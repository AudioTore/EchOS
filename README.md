- Message of the day: (1/4/2023)

Hey everyone! Well this year seems to be doing fine.
I hope you guys are all doing good! Just to let you guys know
EchOS from scratch will NOT have a eta or a estimated time of arrival
to when the update will come out. I have decided that because of how
big of an update this is it wouldn't make sense to try and put pressure
on making to the deadline :) it will be done when its done. Anyways
thats all I had to say thank you to those who have downloaded EchOS!
