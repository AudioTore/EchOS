 Oh sorry! I forgot one thing :) I miss the simplicty of using basic C# then typing in 0xb8000 = "3948bb94" which
 doesn't even make sense.. C# was super easy to use with OS development.. Sooo Because of stopping the development
 of Assembly and C++ port. Sadly It became a little too diffcult to say I always had to relay on other people
 to fix my problems and I really don't like that.. It was so much easier with Cosmos. However. We will not be using
 C# to continue development. I will have richard developing the java compiler because we will use Java instead of Cosmos
 while at the sametime having the same simplicty of regular source code. I will be using Cosmos in the meantime while
 he works on it because I am behind on updates! Take care :)

About

EtchOS Is an Dos operating System written in C# With the help of Cosmos!

How to install:

Sadly It is unable to boot on real hardware and will need vmware or a virtual machine for this to work.

The best way to install EchOS would be a virtual machine anyway since their is not a resson to install it on real hardware.
