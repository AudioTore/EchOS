- Message of the day: (1/14/2023)

Hey everyone! I really hope 2023 is going well because
I'm gonna bring some news to the table. I'm putting EchOS on hiatus.
I've been burntout recently and I really just want to take a break.
"When will development start again?" When I feel like it. I understand
its taking a Lot of time to release our huge 1.6 update but again theres
no eta. Its coming when its coming. Anyways I hope 2023 continues to go well
if it already is. cya and happy new year!
